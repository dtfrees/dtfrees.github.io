Write a 5-6 sentence “statistical methods” section.\nTo analyze the influence of Specific Leaf Area (SLA), Species Type, and water treatment on total biomass of plant roots and shoots. We used five different linear regression models. These included a null model with no predictors (model 0)(, a saturated model with all three predictors (model 1),a model with SLA and water treatment (model 2), a model with SLA and Species Type (model 3), and a model with water treatment and Species Type (model 4). To choose the final model that best predicts the total biomass and is the least complex, we used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Model 4 (water treatment and Species Type) had the lowest AIC (-159.2) and was therefore the best model to use. I then plotted and analyzed the diagnostics of Model 4, where I visually assessed that the residuals were homoscedastic, normally distributed and outliers were not an issue.\n\n\nc. Visualization\n\nModel predictions\n\nmodel_preds &lt;- ggpredict(model4, \n                         terms = c(\n                                   \"water_treatment\", \n                                   \"species_name\"))\n\n# use View(model_preds) to see the predictions as a data frame\n# use model_preds to see the predictions formatted nicely\n\nView(model_preds)\n\n\n\nVisualization code\n\n# creating new data frame of model predictions for plotting\nmodel_preds_for_plotting &lt;- model_preds %&gt;% \n  rename(# renaming columns to make this easier to use\n         water_treatment = x,\n         species_name = group)\n\n# use View(model_preds_for_plotting) \n# to compare this to the original model_preds data frame\n\nggplot() +\n  # underlying data\n  geom_jitter(data = drought_exp_clean, # use original clean data for underlying points\n              aes(x = water_treatment, # water treatment on the x axis\n                  y = total_g, #total biomass on the y axis\n                  color = water_treatment), # color the points by water treatment\n              alpha = 0.3,  # make underlying data transparent\n              width = 0.1,  # make the underlying data jittered horizontally\n              height = 0) + # make the underlying data have no vertical jitter\n  # show points in underlying data\n  geom_point(data = model_preds_for_plotting, # use the model predictions\n             aes(x = water_treatment, \n                 y = predicted, # predicted total_g on the y axis\n                 color = water_treatment)) +\n     # model prediction 95% CI errorbar\n  geom_errorbar(data = model_preds_for_plotting,\n              aes(x = water_treatment,\n                  y = predicted,\n                  ymin = conf.low, #use the confidence interval in the model_preds df\n                  ymax = conf.high),\n              alpha = 0.2) + # decrease opacity\n  # cleaner theme\n  theme_classic() + \n  # no legend\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  # creating different panels for each species\n  facet_wrap(~ species_name) +\n  # change colors\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Well watered\" = \"#afe67c\", \n                                \"Drought stressed\" = \"#cab90df0\")) +\n  # labels\n  labs(title = \"Chart 1: Predicted Response by Species and Water Treatment\", # titles\n       x = \"Water Treatment ~ Species\",\n       y = \"Total Biomass (g)\",\n       caption = \"Chart 1: This plot shows the output of a linear regression model \n       predicting how the total mass of a plant can be predicted by species type\n       and water treatment.

    "text": "Problem 3\nAn assessment of the effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas in the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA\n\na. Revisit and Summarize\nThe authors used Principal Component Analysis (PCA), One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and a Pearson product-moment correlation matrix. The PCA was used to explore site and species relationships. The ANOVA was used to see the significance of each variable that had an influence on the clustering of the sites and species. Finally, the correlation matrix was used to find relationships between abiotic variables.\n\n\n\nSource: Tuya et al., 2000\n\n\n\n\nb. Visual Clarity\nI think the authors did a good job representing their One-Way ANOVA statistics clearly relative to the complexity of their analyses. The x and y axis are in a logical position; however I think they could have had less intervals on the y-axis because it is not very clear on the units of density and I think what matters much more is to show if the density are relatively higher or lower. They did not do a great job showing underlying data or summary statistics. The bar-and-whisker plot leaves out any underlying data and does not show the low end of the SE or CI whisker (it did not specify what the whisker represented).\n\n\nc. Aesthetic clarity\nI think that the authors had a balanced data:ink ratio; none of the ink was pointless. The only extraneous info that I would have taken out would have been to thin the intervals on the y-axis. There are the borders around the plots and the filled in bars which are extra ink, but I think that they are useful in differentiating the space and showing which statistics were significant and which one weren’t. To lessen the amount of ink on the page they could possibly use hatching instead of a complete fill on the bars.\n\n\nd. Recommendations\nMy first recommendation would be to create fewer intervals on the y-axis because I don’t think the main message of the figure is enhanced at all by more specificity of the density of the urchins. My second recommendation would be to add the underlying data of the different urchin densities across sites and sizes. I would do this by adding a jitter plot of these points faceted and grouped in the same way the bars are. I would also keep the current coloring by having the small urchin data points a different color than the other ones, but put the coloring on on the jittered points. If they did not want jittered points I would recommend to hatch the bars instead of filling them to help the data:ink ratio. Finally, I would also add a mean point and 95% Confidence Interval error bar in place of the bar-and-whisker, this would show the underlying data and the low end of the CI."

    "text": "I have an emphasis in Geography within my Environmental Studies Major. I took the three class series on Geographic Information Systems and Science (GIS) that the UCSB Geography Department offers. From these courses I found that I greatly enjoy working with geo-spatial data because of its versatility and wide array of visualization techniques.\nThe series included:\n\n\n\nBasic spatial data management and display in ArcGIS Pro.\nTaught by Professor Somayeh Dodge\n\n\n\n\nA rudimentary map from a lab in 176a, Fall 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical issues underlying geographic information systems.\nTaught by Professor Alan Murray\n\n\n\n\nA map showing the reock compactness of school districts compared with demographics using Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) in a lab in 176b , Winter 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning, design, analysis, and presentation of a GIS pilot study.\nI am currently working with a group on a suitability analysis for prescribed burn and forest mastication areas in Yosemite National Park in ArcGIS Pro.\nWe will design, execute, and present our research within the ten week course.\nTaught by Professor Peter Kedron"
