## [Some of my favorite Environmental Policy Courses]{.underline}

My studies have shown me how much of a role that policy plays in shaping a sustainable and environmentally centered future. Here are some of the main courses that have instilled me with this sentiment.

### **Public Lands and Waters - Law and Policy**

-   Introduction to law and policy surrounding public lands and waters.

-   This course was extremely comprehensive. It provided me with an excellent understanding of our public lands are currently and have been managed and how we can have a say in this management.

-   Introduction to the history, theory, trends, and practice of environmental land use planning in California.
-   Provided in depth education how NEPA and CEQA play a role in zoning and development.
-   Our final project guided us through attending a local Planning Commission meeting and doing a report on the various aspects that go into putting a project through all fo the required processes.
