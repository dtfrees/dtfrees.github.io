### Some of my favorite Environmental Policy Courses

-   **Public Lands and Waters - Law and Policy**

    -   Introduction to law and policy surrounding public lands and waters.

    -   This course was extremely comprehensive. It provided me with an excellent understanding of our public lands are currently and have been managed and how we can have a say in this management.
