Had you have asked me where I was going on a surf trip in January 2024 you would have heard all about my plan to go surf in Lobitos, Peru. I had already taken my sights off of the classic post-grad Indonesian excursion and had began to plan a wild South American goose chase of empty lefts in Peru. As months rolled by and my travel partner-in-crime, Nathaniel, and I procrastinated every part of the research we should have been partaking in. We were busy trying to pass our final classes and wanted to get the most out of our last moments of living in Isla Vista. June snuck up on us quick and by then we had lost the motivation for Peru. It seemed too expensive and fickle.

Every surfer in college at one point or another says, "As soon as I graduate I'm headed to Indo"; at least in my experience. Thats what Nathaniel had been saying since I met him three years ago at a UCSB Surf Team party. And thats what he said when we graduated. By mid-July we had our tickets. I think Nathaniel's cost around \$1000 after all fees paid, and mine was \$1200.

In August we booked lodging for our first 17 nights. The first five nights we are staying at the [Kubu Containers](https://www.booking.com/hotel/id/kubu-container.html?aid=318615&label=New_English_EN_CA%3A_California_23537601625-oZDzm33GH6aIUa0SqqPZ0AS640819000230%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg&sid=12c92e471d51a1684c8bdaf6acc0e65a&dest_id=325689;dest_type=city;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=1;hpos=1;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;srepoch=1725692105;srpvid=c47b309e2e0005ea;type=total;ucfs=1&) in Bali and the next 12 are at a homestay in [Lakey Peak](https://www.booking.com/hotel/id/danny-juljol-homestay-kabupaten-dompu.html).

## **Stop 1: Bali**

At 10:05PM on September 7th my plane left the ground in San Francisco and my plane touched down at 4:50AM on September 9th in Singapore. That was a long time in the air.

9/9/24 – I waited another 2 hours for Nathaniel to arrive. We decided to set out on our own to find the Gardens by th Bay in Downtown Singapore. Our first mission was to navigate Singapore's extensive train system, which luckily had a lot of service to the Changi airport and was **easy** to buy a transit card at the station (cough cough take notes SF clipper cards). After a 30 minute train ride and some aimless humid wandering around the towering business district we found our way to the enormous and impressive Gardens by the Bay mall and supertrees.

`Side note: If you want food that isn't coffee or pastries before 11 AM in Singapore, you're going to have a tough time. Better to try in the airport.`

We took the train back to the airport and hopped on our 2 hour flight to Denpasar. Outside the airport was the usual barrage of taxi drivers bidding on your business. We found a guy who we got down to 350k. I don't know if that was a good or bad deal fro the 1 hour ride to Uluwatu, but it was 9PM and we just wanted to get to a real bed. We arrived at our Kubu Containers, walked to the store, bought some Bintangs, hopped in bed and passed out.

9/12/24 – It is now day 3 in Bali, we have surfed Uluwatu twice a day for the last two days, I have become all too friendly with the reef, and have paid and average of \$3-6 per meal depending on if I get a smoothie or not. Nathaniel and I have for the most part only eaten at this place called [Warung Local.](https://www.instagram.com/warunglocal/) The place seems sanitary, has a large variety of food items, and is \$3 for a plate of Nasi Goreng (Fried Rice). As for my relationship with the reef, I have encountered it pulling into my biggest barrel and smallest barrel of the trip.

The crowd at Uluwatu is thick and greedy, I am not one to steal someones waves nor bump shoulders to get one, so my strategy during the peak hours has been to sit on the beginning of a sectiony part of the wave and take off when people fall. This has been especiallly lucrative since we have been surfing Racetracks. A notoriously fast wave, as seen below.

On Saturday we head to Lakey Peak. An interesting journey ahead

## **Stop 2: Hu'u**

After looking at the price of flights + boards + taxis we were looking at around \$800 to get to Lakey Peak and back. So after reading [an article](https://hostevie.com/blog/west-sumbawa-indonesia-surf-trip/) about scootering to West Sumbawa (we were going to the East side), and watching [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJgPRW4YKDo) of a couple people who did it, we decided to commit to our two day journey. We booked a place in West Lombok as a halfway point and stored our board bags at the place we were staying in Bali. On Friday we visited the Uluwatu Hindu Temple to see the famous temple on the bluff, but mostly to see the monkeys.

![Just three religous figures giving blessings to all](peace.jpeg){width="300" fig-align="left"}

Its a long road to Hu'u.

We woke up at 4:30AM in an effort to catch the 6:30 ferry out of Padangbai. From Uluwatu it was a 2 hour ride during sunrise through the city and along the coast with the city waking up around us as we got closer to the ferry port. The rules of the road are much different in Indonesia. It took a while to get used to driving on the opposite side of the road, especially without the constant reminder of the steering wheel being in the center of the road. Another change is that there seems to be not much conformity on what side to pass on (this gets even more interesting when the roads turn to a two lane highway). We pulled into Padangbai just after 6:30, missing the ferry, damn. Luckily another ferry was leaving at 9:30 so we bought tickets, bought some petrol from some old men on the corner who had what seemed to be fighting roosters in wooden cages, and had some \$2 smoothies while we waited.

![This beauty of a dragonfruit smoothie cost us a bit more than 2 bucks](IMG_1624.jpg){width="200" fig-align="left"}

`Quick tip: Don't wait around to get on the ferry, especially the Padangbai-Lembar Ferry. It gets packed quick.`

We got on around 8:30 and my bike was in the very last row on the ferry. They made me take my surfboards off my bike so I looked a bit odd and awkward carrying my two boards through the crowded ferry. Once we got upstairs we quickly realized we would be spending the next 5 hours on the ground, it was packed. Luckily, we had been up since 4 and falling asleep wasn't too much of an issue.

The winds blow heavy and straight in the Indonesian afternoon. For the next three hours we tacked into the heart of Lombok with our fiberglass sails pushing us where we needed to go. As you go the roads will go from nicely paved 2 lane freeways to swiss-cheese potholed roads that should be a one-way. Both are driven on by the same vehicles, and often afforded the same speed limit. There are no double yellow lines (actually there was about a quarter mile of double yellow in the whole 350 miles), and its mostly dashed passing lane with about at much "no passing zone" as you would find "passing zone" on Highway 1. As we reached the East side of the Island the air filled with the sound of Islamic Azans. From Mosque to Mosque we rode listening to the loud grainy speakers preaching to us in a foreign tongue. We reached out "East Lombok Dive Hotel" just before sunset. When we arrived the place was completely empty, but our stress was quickly quelled when our host arrived right after us. For \$12.50 a night is was an awesome pot right on the sand with some much needed A/C, beds, and a shower. We picked up some food at the local Warung, found the only beer in 100 miles and rested up for our early departure.

![One of the nicest roads we travelled on that day](pass.mov){width="375"}

Another early departure at 5:30 AM to the Kayangan Port about 15 minutes South of our hotel. We bought tickets from a roadside stall and after some messing around with google translate the salesman got across to us that the ferry leaves when it fills up. Well at least thats what we thought he said. We were some of the first people on this ferry, a refreshing moment compared to the day before, and after buying and trying some interesting banana leaf wrapped "Nasi Ayam Goreng" (Chicken Fried Rice), which turned out to be "Nasi Ikan Goreng" (Fish Fried Rice) that had a rotten aroma to it I decided it was better to go hungry than have "Lombok Belly" for our long day of riding.

The ride to Lakey Peak was routed to 6.5 hours for 210 miles of riding, but we did closer 9. Starting at 8:30 we weaved through town after town stopping once for a morning snack, once for a gas fill up, and once before our last strech to Lakey. We rode North East through arid desert, lush jungle, corn, rice, and tobacco farmland, over a mountain pass, and finally back to the South East coast. Some interesting things we saw along the way were a number of children who were below pre-teen years driving themselves and often a friend or two along the highway, a large dead lizard in the road, a family of five on a scooter (From Back to Front: Mom holding baby, child, Dad, child at feet), many corn farmers laying corn out to ?dry? on tarps, and "Big Daddy" (see below).

We arrived in Lakey Peak just before 5 burnt, dirty, and with numb butts. We pulled into Danny Jujol Homestay and we very relieved when he greeted us right at the gate and led us to our room. Fully equipped with A/C AND hot water we are living large. Hungry, and tired after a shower we went looking for food. Down the street we found Lela's Warung. We were invited into an empty warung by her daughter sitting on their front porch. Her mom, who I assume is Lela, came out and we both order the Fried chicken Noodle (Mie Ayam Goreng) for 30,000 rupiah (\$2). After about 15 minutes she popped out with a mother-feeding-two-hungry-boys portion of food. We scarfed it down (DELICOUS), chased it with a Bintang and headed to bed.

We woke up this morning ready to get in the water and not on a scooter. We decided to paddle out to Lakey Peak even though there are 2 other waves in the bay and many others a short ride away. We did the 400m paddle out to the waves which is no problem when teh water is 80 degrees. The lineup had about 20 guys in it with locals, groms, and visitorsn alike. It was about 4-6 ft and wave is like a better Lower Trestles that is ridiculously consistent, so the crowd is no problem. Plus the overall vibe is way better than in Bali. People talk to eachother and are for the most part respectful about waves. After surfing for two and a half hours we paddled in. When we got back to the homestay we were greeted by Danny's wife asking us if we wanted our complementary breakfast. I had chocolate banana pancakes and Nathaniel had an Omelete.

Life is Good.
