## [Some of my favorite Environmental Science Courses]{.underline}

### **Field Study of California’s Coast**

-   We visited various sites along the coast that had restoration projects and interesting physical and social geographic features.

-   Research project on the effects of seasonal changes in kelp forest density on beach wrack and beach productivity.

-   Performed native plant identification and did vegetation transect surveys.

-   Taught by [Ian Walker](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/ian-walker)

### **Stats for Environmental Science**

-   Learned about descriptive statistics, analyzing differences between populations, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and types of bias. We applied all these concepts in RStudio data analysis.
-   I also built this website in this class!
-   Taught by [An Bui](https://an-bui.com/)
-   Some examples of my work in R:

[An example of my data visualization from an assignment:]{.underline}

```{r}
#| output: false
#| eval: false
---
ggplot(data = CFT_Data, #use original dataframe
              aes(x = Type, #x-axis is the dryweight of algae or pickleweed left
              y = Post_Trial_Dryweight_g, # y is the type of experiment it was control or treatment (normally on the x but for a horizontal jitter this is required)
              color = Tissue)) + # classify the colors of th data according
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, # change the width of the horizontal jitter
              height = 0, # make the height of the horizontal jitter 0
              alpha = 0.2) + # make the underlying data transparent
   stat_summary(geom = "pointrange", # make the 
               fun.data = mean_se, # display the mean and the standard error of the data in the pointrange
               size = 0.5) + #make the mean point larger to differentiate from the underlying data
  facet_wrap( ~ Assigned_TTT + Tissue) + # create separate plots for each trial and each Tissue type 
  guides(color = "none") + # lake out the legend for the "color = Tissue" in the ggplot(aes())
  theme_classic() + # choose a theme without gridlines
  scale_color_manual(values=c("darkgreen", "cornflowerblue"))  + # change the colors of the Tissue
  labs(x = "Post-Trial Mean Dryweight (g)
       +/- Std. Error",# add an x-axis title
       y = "")  # take out the y-axis title because we only need the tick marks to explain it
```

[Organizing data from multiple linear regression models into a table:]{.underline}

```{r}
#| output: false
#| eval: false
---
rows <- tribble(~term,~null,~"model 1", ~"model 2", ~"model 3", ~"model 4",
'AIC ∆', '81.22','2.44', '60.37','32.12', '0.00',) # create a manual tribble to add the aic delta to the table
attr(rows, 'position') <- c(20)#put the new row in the 20th row of the table

# comparing models
modelsummary <- modelsummary::modelsummary( # this function takes a list of models
list(
"Null" = model0, # "model name" = model object
"Model 1" = model1,
"Model 2" = model2,
"Model 3" = model3,
"Model 4" = model4
),
add_rows = rows, #add the manually made tibble to the table
gof_map = c("r.squared", "aic"), #only include the r squared and aic in the goodness of fit stats
title = "Table 1: Linear Regression of effect of SLA, Water Treatment, and Various Plant Species on Total Biomass", #add a title
statistic = c("p= {p.value}"), # make only p value statistics added to the table
output = "flextable", #make the output table a flextable so it can be edited as one
stars = TRUE #add stars to statistically significant values
)

modelsummary %>%
autofit() %>% #make the spacing of the columns reasonable
border_inner_v() %>% #make vertical lines in between the cells
border_inner_h() %>% #make horizontal lines in between the cells
bg(i = c(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19:21), bg = "grey") %>% #make the background of certain rows grey
bold(part = "header") # make the headers of the columns bold
```

### **Applied Ecology**

-   This class taught me about ecological concepts and discussed them in the context of current challenges in environmental management and conservation.
-   Taught by [Claudia Tyler](https://es.ucsb.edu/claudia-tyler)
