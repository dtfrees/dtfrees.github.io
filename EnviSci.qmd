### Some of my favorite Environmental Science Courses

-   [**Field Study of Californiaâ€™s Coast**]{.underline}

    -   We visited various sites along the coast that had restoration projects and interesting physical and social geographic features.

    -   Research project on the effects of seasonal changes in kelp forest density on beach wrack and beach productivity.

    -   Performed native plant identification and did vegetation transect surveys.

    -   Taught by [Ian Walker](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/ian-walker)

-   [**Stats for Environmental Science**]{.underline}

    -   Learned about descriptive statistics, analyzing differences between populations, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and types of bias. We applied all these concepts in RStudio data analysis.
    -   Taught by [An Bui](https://an-bui.com/)

-   [**Applied Ecology**]{.underline}

    -   This class taught me about ecological concepts and discussed them in the context of current challenges in environmental management and conservation.
