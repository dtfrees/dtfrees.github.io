## [My Interest in GIS [{{< fa book-atlas title="Atlas" >}}](https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview#:~:text=GIS%20connects%20data%20to%20a,science%20and%20almost%20every%20industry.)]{.underline}

I have an emphasis in Geography within my Environmental Studies Major. I took the three class series on Geographic Information Systems and Science (GIS) that the UCSB Geography Department offers. From these courses I found that I greatly enjoy working with geo-spatial data because of its versatility and wide array of visualization techniques.
