### My Interest in GIS {{< fa book-atlas title="Atlas" >}}

I have an emphasis in Geography within my Environmental Studies Major. I took the three class series on Geographic Information Systems and Science (GIS) that the UCSB Geography Department offers.

The series included:

-   Intro to GIS

    -   Basic spatial data management and display in ArcGIS Pro.

-   GIS Applications

    -   Planning, design, analysis, and presentation of a GIS pilot study.
    -   I am currently working on a suitability analysis for prescribed burn and forest mastication areas in Yosemite National Park.
