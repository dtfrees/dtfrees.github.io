### Welcome!

Welcome to my website, thanks for visiting! I'm Dylan Freebairn-Smith and I made this website to catalog my studies at UCSB and other things going on in my life!

I am from a small town called [Gualala](https://www.gualala.com/) in Southern Mendocino County. I love challenging myself intellectually and physically, both professionally and in my free time.

I am currently working as a Conservation Analyst for [Friends of Gualala River](gualalariver.org), a Scientific Aid for [CDFW's Groundfish Management Project](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/Groundfish), and helping a local ecologist restore her property's ecosystems. By the end of 2025 I hope to begin working closer to the San Francisco Bay Area, but I am willing to get experience wherever opportunities arise! My [resume](https://dtfrees.github.io/posts/2024-07-24-resume/) can be found on the Projects page.

This website showcases my main three categories that I studied at UC Santa Barbara: GIS, Environmental Science, and Environmental Policy, and is now a repository for projects and adventures I have worked on. These can be found in the [Projects](https://dtfrees.github.io/posts.html) page. I will keep expanding it to encompass more of my accomplishments and interests!
