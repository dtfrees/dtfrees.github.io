### Welcome!

Welcome to my website, thanks for visiting! I'm Dylan Freebairn-Smith and I made this website to catalog just some of my studies at UCSB!

I am from a small town called [Gualala](https://www.gualala.com/) in Southern Mendocino County. I love challenging myself intellectually and physically, both professionally and in my free time.

For now, this website showcases my courses from the main three categories that I studied at UC Santa Barbara: GIS, Environmental Science, and Environmental Policy, along with some projects I have worked on in the [Misc.](https://dtfrees.github.io/posts.html) page. I will keep expanding it to encompass more of my accomplishments and interests!

### Education

**Environmental Studies B.A.** (2024) \| University of California, Santa Barbara

**Point Arena High School** (2020)
