### Welcome!

Welcome to my website, thanks for visiting! I'm Dylan Freebairn-Smith and I made this website to catalog just some of my studies at UCSB and other interesting things going on in my life!

I am from a small town called [Gualala](https://www.gualala.com/) in Southern Mendocino County. I love challenging myself intellectually and physically, both professionally and in my free time.

I am currently looking for work in ecological restoration, ideally in the San Francisco Bay Area, but I am willing to get experience wherever opportunities arise! My [resume](https://dtfrees.github.io/posts/2024-07-24-resume/) can be found on my Misc. page.

This website showcases my courses from the main three categories that I studied at UC Santa Barbara: GIS, Environmental Science, and Environmental Policy, along with some projects I have worked on in the [Misc.](https://dtfrees.github.io/posts.html) page. I will keep expanding it to encompass more of my accomplishments and interests!
