Outside of my studies and work I am avid surfer, backpacker, diver, and mushroom hunter; among many other outdoor hobbies. I love spending time outdoors and learning about nature.

### How I made this Website

I made this website with Quarto, R, and GitHub. Check out my repository here {{< fa arrow-right title="Right Pointing arrow" >}} [{{< fa brands github title="The GitHub octocat logo" >}}](https://github.com/dtfrees/dtfrees.github.io).

And check out the instructions by Sam Csick I used [here](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/).
